## Running the Jupyter Lab notebook

If you do not already have Jupyter **Lab** in your python virtual environment, then follow the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install) to install it.

Next, add Mito to your python virtual environment by following the instructions [here](https://docs.trymito.io/getting-started/installing-mito/installing-mito-inside-a-virtual-environment). Please note that the free version of Mito has telemetry that you cannot disable. Moreover, you will have to sign-up for an account (inside the Jupyter Lab interface) the first time your run Mito.

The spreedsheets are in the `data` folder if you would prefer to modify them in another way (e.g. LibreOffice or Google Sheets).
